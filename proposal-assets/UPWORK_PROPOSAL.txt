Hi — I built a live, production-ready SMS reminder MVP for barbershops.

What's working:
- Client dashboard — add/edit/delete clients with reminder dates
- Monthly SMS via Twilio — fires automatically on each client's cut day
- Test SMS button — send a real message instantly from the dashboard
- SMS delivery logs — full history of every message sent
- Mobile-responsive UI — works on any device

Built with Next.js + Neon Postgres + Twilio + Vercel Cron.
Ships in 7 days. Fixed $75. Ready to start today.
